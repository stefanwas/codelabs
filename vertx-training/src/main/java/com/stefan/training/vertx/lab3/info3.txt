Lab3 shows how to use HTTP Server (it is probably netty server)

To check if the server is up just open browser and goto localhost:8080

Vert.x HttpServer does not by default close the TPC Connection (browser send Header: 'Connection:keep-alive')

Jetty Server was used only to compare the behavior

lsof -i -P | grep localhost:8080
